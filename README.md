# ☁️ Cloud Computing Labs

This repository contains all the Cloud Computing practical labs that I have completed as part of my college coursework, documented for future reference. 

The repository is divided into folders, for the labs done in different cloud environments (AWS, Google Cloud, Azure). Each folder includes setup steps, screenshots and code files. 

All the resources are created temporarily and deleted after use to avoid unnecessary costs. No projects are currently hosted, this repository contains only documentation.
